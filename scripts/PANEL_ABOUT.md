### jastronaut's panel adventure

![panel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jastronaut/dotfiles/master/scrots/panel_preview.png)

After using conky, then i3blocks for my status bar, I decided to take the jump and try lemonbar. I'm really new with this, so bear with me.

## panel features

- time/date
- workspace numbers
- battery status (with dynamic colors)
- current cmus song

## TODO

- add a reboot/shutdown click thing
- add spotify status
- find a wallpaper that looks nice with it
